## TLDR:

- A pure Swift 360 video player as a demo of this framework, with some fancy features such as color filters etc.
- An open and reliable framework to handle 3D graphics with a focus on videos, Apple's SceneKit satisfying none of those two qualities.
- A number of SceneKit's features are missing, but the one implemented are:
  - An easy to use syntax and logic
  - Elements that can have any shape / position
  - Support of image and video textures
  - Direct and easy access to shader's code, shaders modifiers.
  - Focus on reliability on video texture support.
